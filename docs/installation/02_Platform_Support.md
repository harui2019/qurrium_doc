# Platform Support

The followings are the OS and hardware architecture we support.

It's basically following [the platform support of qiskit](https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/start/install#operating-system-support).

## Available Python Version

![Available Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.9_|_3.10_|_3.11_|_3.12-blue?logo=python&logoColor=white) [![Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/qurrium)](https://pepy.tech/project/qurrium)

Qurry is written in Python 3.9 type hint syntax.
It can't and won't support Python 3.8 and below since they are too old.

## Available Operation System and Processor Architecture

We strongly recommend to use Linux based system, due to Python multiprocessing may exist some unknown issue on Windows and the GPU acceleration of `Qiskit`, `qiskit-aer-gpu` only works with Nvidia CUDA on Linux.

1. There are some issues on building.
2. The functions written in Rust are not avaiable.

- Note: All linux are based on `manylinux2014`

- **All ManyLinux 2014 compatible distro**
  Ubuntu 18.04+ LTS, Rocky Linux, ...

  - on `x86_64` **(recommended)**
  - on `x86_64` Windows 10/11 WSL2 **(recommended)**
  - on `aarch64`
    - Fujitsu Quantum Simulator with `qiskit-qulacs` making `qulacs` as a `qiskit` backend to run.
    - Android Terminal emulator `Termux` with `proto-distro`, so you can run this on your Android device if you know how to do.
      - If you want to try this, I suggest using the devices with sufficient performance CPU like Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 with 10GiB RAM at least.
      - See ["Quantum computing right at your fingertips"](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1-dQWdSFYB/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) :)
      - iSH on iOS/iPadOS can not even handle python environment building although iPad has powerful performance :(

- **Windows 10/11** on `x86_64`, `x86_32`, `ARM64`

- **MacOS 11+**
  - on `arm64 (Apple Silicon)`
  - on `x86_64 (Intel chips)`
