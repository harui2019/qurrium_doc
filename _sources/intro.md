# Qurry üçõ - The python package for measuring quantum entanglement entropy and wave function overlap.

## _The python package that makes the randomized measurement easy._

The major function includes the measurement of quantum Renyi Entropy and Wave Function Overlap based on the randomized measurement protocol.
When interfaced with **IBM Qiskit**, the package automates the workflow from creating experiment objects, job submission and recall and postprocessing.  
There are several additional features, such as measurement of magnetization and error mitigation. Please check them out!
